## Features

- **Command-Based Functionality**: Use the `/archive` command to format Discord markdown into MediaWiki wikitext. Supported features include:
    - Basic formatting (e.g., italics, quotes, underlining).
    - Replies and forwarded messages.
- **Privacy Controls**: Restricts commands to authorized users and specific channels to ensure discussions are logged securely.
- **Participant Mapping**: Maps verified discussion participants from Discord accounts to their corresponding wiki accounts for accountability.


## Impact

- Serves a **300+ member Discord server**, facilitating over **30 monthly text discussions**.
- Reduces logging time from **1 hour to just 10 seconds**, significantly improving efficiency.

## Motivation

This project was born out of a need to streamline the logging process for a popular music-related wiki with over 50 active editors. Regular decision-making discussions on Discord often required manual transcription into wikitext, which was time-consuming (30 minutes to 1 hour). The bot provides a simple solution that allows even non-technical moderators to log discussions in seconds using a single command.

## Development Insights

- **Tooling**: Development was accelerated using Cursor, cutting development time in half.
- **Lessons Learned**:
    - Importance of testing and gathering feedback from non-technical users.
    - Effective organization of projects for ease of use and scalability.

## Future Plans

- Explore additional Discord bot scripts to automate administrative processes on the wiki (pending community approval).
- Consider expanding the bot's availability for other wiki Discords with similar needs.
